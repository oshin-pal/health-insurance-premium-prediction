## 🛠 Installation & Usage

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rajat-kumar-mondal/health-insurance-premium-prediction.git
cd health-insurance-premium-prediction
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r app/requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Application
```bash
streamlit run app/main.py
```

## 📊 Dataset
The project uses multiple datasets (containing 50K records), to analyze customer profiles and predict health insurance cost:
- **`premiums.csv`**: Core dataset containing customer demographics and premium values
- **`segmented_data/`**: Segmented data for improved model efficiency and reduce error
- **`more_data_with_genetic_risk/`**: Extended dataset with genetic risk feature

## 📦 Libraries & Packages
The project utilizes the following key libraries:
- **pandas** – Data manipulation and analysis  
- **numpy** – Numerical computations  
- **matplotlib.pyplot & seaborn** – Data visualization   
- **scikit-learn**:
  - `train_test_split` – Splitting data into training and testing sets  
  - `MinMaxScaler` – Feature scaling  
  - `LinearRegression` – Regression model
  - `Ridge` - Ridge regression model   
  - `RandomizedSearchCV` – Hyperparameter tuning
  - `mean_squared_error` – Model evaluation metrics 
- **statsmodels**:
  - `variance_inflation_factor` – Detecting multicollinearity  
- **xgboost** – Gradient boosting model  
- **joblib**:
  - `dump` – Store the models and scaler objects
- **streamlit** - App user interface (UI)

## 🤖 Model Training & Evaluation
The model was trained with various techniques to improve prediction accuracy:
### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values through imputation strategies.
- Encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
- Feature scaling with **MinMaxScaler**.
- Removing multicollinearity using **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)**.
  - **Data Segmentation**
    - Data segmentation for precise model building and error reduction.
      
### 2️⃣ Model Development
  - Models trained separately for:
    - **Young individuals (Age <= 25)**
    - **Rest population (Age > 25)**
    - **Both groups with genetic risk considerations**
      
### 3️⃣ Model Selection
Three machine learning models were trained and compared:
- **Linear Regression**: A simple regression model for predicting continuous values.
- **Ridge Regression**: A regression method that introduces regularization to reduce overfitting and improve model generalization.
- **XGBoost Regression**: An optimized gradient boosting algorithm designed for speed and performance.

### 4️⃣ Hyperparameter Tuning
- **RandomizedSearchCV** was applied to refine model parameters.

### 5️⃣ Model Evaluation Metrices
  - **Accuracy**
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**

## 📈 Performance of the best model (i.e., XGBoost)
- **Young Model:**
  - **Accuracy:** 98.76%
  - **MSE:** 93545.52
  - **RMSE:** 305.85
  - **Extreme errors:** 2.48% (initially ~73%) [Note: The error has been reduced through error analysis and by considering genetic risk features.]

- **Rest Model:**
  - **Accuracy:** 99.70%
  - **MSE:** 243847.75
  - **RMSE:** 493.80
  - **Extreme errors:** 0.32%
